# About this file from CMPSC-131
This is an assignment from my CMPSC 131 class, which I took in the Fall 2022 semester. It was one I was particularly proud of because I really enjoyed learning about node traversing, and it really stuck with me. Especially when it came to later learning in my compilers and computer architecture course.    
The course was based on learning Python and was an intro course for the computer science major.
